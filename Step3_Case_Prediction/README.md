# Step3: Case Prediction

By using `model.py`, the number of cases can be predicted.

Input csv file example:
- `beta_Data.csv` : to refer the actual beta values until now.
- `beta_pred_6.csv`: to use predicted beta values.
- `I_new.csv` and `I_new.csv`: these files are used only for getting the initial values.
In this folder, Japan data from Feb 21 are uploaded as an example.

Output csv file example:
- `NewI_dash_6.csv`: to know only the last point of forecasts.
- `NewI_all_6.csv`: to know all forecast values.
