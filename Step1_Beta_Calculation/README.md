Step 1: Beta Calculation

The following data are necessary to calculate infection rate (beta) as csv file. All data should be moving-averaged.
- Number of newly infected people
- Number of current infected people
- Number of total removed (because of recovery or death) people 

In addition, population information needs to be added in the source code.

In the current version, Japan data from Jan 19 are uploaded as an example.
