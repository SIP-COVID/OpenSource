# Step 1: Beta Calculation

The following data are necessary to calculate infection rate (beta) as csv file. All data should be moving-averaged.
- Number of newly infected people `I_new.csv`
- Number of current infected people `I_now.csv`
- Number of total removed (because of recovery or death) people `Rem.csv` 

In addition, population information and the number of days need to be added in the source code.

In the current version, Japan data from Jan 19 are uploaded as an example.
